Bus-Bus
-----

**This package was a PoC. Please use a better suported one like: https://github.com/SimpleBus/CommandBus**

Bus-bus is a messaging bus implementation for commands AKA a command bus.
The main idea is to provide a way to interact with a specific CORE layer in a decoupled way.

This project started for a pet project and was reused in different projects.
So finally it become open sourcered to make it easier to maintain.

The implementation was based on the article [Hexagonal Architecture](http://fideloper.com/hexagonal-architecture) of @fideloper
